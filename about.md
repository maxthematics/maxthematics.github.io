I work at the intersection of mathematics and mathematics education—currently as *Akademischer Rat* (non-permanent) at Paderborn University's Institute of Mathematics.

## What I do

In my work, I connect **mathematics**, **mathematics education**, and **illustration**—from school classrooms to university courses to public outreach. My main areas are **geometry**, **mathematics teacher education**, and the intersection of **mathematics and computer science**.

Since 2025, I serve as Principal Investigator for public outreach in the [SFB-TRR 358](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/).

## Background

I studied mathematics and computer science for secondary education at Paderborn University and received my PhD in 2022. I also completed the German *Referendariat*—an 18-month practical teacher training—finishing with the second state examination.
